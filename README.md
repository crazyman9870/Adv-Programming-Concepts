# Adv-Programming-Concepts
This is class includes my first programs written in the Java language.

Inside there are several small programs including:

-Image Editor (Lab 1)

-A Spell Corrector (Lab 2)

-Grep and Line Counter (Lab 3)

-Evil Hangman Game (Lab 4)

After exploring the basics with Java, the main program in this package is the Record Indexer.
This is a mock version of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' Family Search Indexing Program.
There is a complete front and back end to this project. A server with a SQLite database on the backend, and a GUI for the client on the front end.
